When Uddhava goes to Vrindavan, the eager and anxious milkmaids mistake him for Krishna, for he comes in the same chariot that took Krishna away and as Krishna’s cousin, he has similar features. But then they realize, Uddhava is no Krishna. He does not know how to comfort. He does not know how to be emotional. He is calm and composed like a priest, passing on the news with accuracy, not understanding why the women wail like children.

Uddhava advises the gopikas to read the scriptures that speak how the world is full of change and suffering and how the wise detach themselves from worldly things. The milkmaids, led by Radha lash back. This forms the basis of the famous Bhramar geet, song of the bee, where the milkmaids equate themselves with the flower that is left behind by the bee after being drained of nectar and fragrance.Krishna, the bee, has moved on to another land, to other women, to other flowers. They do not resent him or wish him to change the course of his life but they want the right to pine for him. This is viraha bhakti, devotion born of separation. Uddhava offers them knowledge to console them, but the women say, “We do not want to be consoled. Where do we put your knowledge? Every being of ours is occupied by memories of Krishna!” Uddhava the intellectual returns humbled by the unconditional love of the milkmaids. The gyan yogi understands the bhakti yogi for the first time.
